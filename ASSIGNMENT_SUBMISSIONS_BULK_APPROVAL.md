- Transaction rollback on errors

## Integration Points

### Existing Features

- Works with existing "✓ Approve All Corrected" button

- Uses existing WhatsApp notification system
- Maintains audit trail (reviewed_by_id, review_date)

### SweetAlert2 Integration

- All confirmation dialogs use SweetAlert2

## Performance Considerations
