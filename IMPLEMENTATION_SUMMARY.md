# Google Drive Picker Integration - Summary of Changes

## Overview

Successfully integrated Google Drive Picker into the assignment creation and editing system. Users can now attach Google Drive files alongside regular file uploads and external links.

## Files Modified

### 1. `website/templates/admin/assignments/assignments.html`

#### Added:

- **Google API Scripts** (in head section):

  ```html
  <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/api.js"></script>
  <script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client"></script>
  ```

- **CSS Styles** for Drive button and UI:

  - `.attachment-type-btn.drive` - Blue button styling to match Google's branding
  - `.drive-auth-status` - Status indicators for authorization state

- **Updated `addAttachmentField()` function**:

  - Added third button: "üìÇ Google Drive"
  - Added hidden inputs for Drive link and token storage
  - Added status display for selected Drive files

- **Updated `toggleAttachmentType()` function**:

  - Now handles three types: file, link, and drive
  - Shows/hides appropriate input fields based on selection

- **Form Submission Handler**:

  - Updated to include Drive link and token when submitting attachments
  - Extracts data from hidden fields: `attachment_drive_link_*` and `attachment_drive_token_*`

- **Google Drive Integration JavaScript**:
  - `initializeGapi()` - Loads Google Drive API
  - `initializeGis()` - Initializes Google Identity Services for OAuth
  - `handleAuthResponse()` - Handles OAuth callback
  - `openDrivePickerForAttachment()` - Opens picker for specific attachment
  - `createPicker()` - Creates and displays the picker dialog
  - `pickerCallback()` - Processes selected file and retrieves metadata

### 2. `website/templates/admin/assignments/edit_assignment.html`

#### Added:

- Same Google API scripts as assignments.html
- Same CSS styles for Drive integration
- Updated attachment display section:
  - Shows existing attachments with type indicators (File/Link/Drive)
  - Styled with proper icons and colors
- Complete attachment management system:
  - `addAttachmentField()` function
  - `removeAttachment()` function
  - `toggleAttachmentType()` function
- Full Google Drive Picker integration (same as assignments.html)

#### Changed:

- Replaced old file-only attachment system with new multi-type system
- Updated HTML structure to show attachment types
- Added proper form field names using `new_attachments[index][field]` format

### 3. `website/admin.py`

#### In `/assignments` route (POST method):

```python
# Added support for 'drive' type attachments (around line 1840)
elif attachment_type == 'drive':
    attachment_url = request.form.get(f'attachments[{idx}][url]')
    drive_token = request.form.get(f'attachments[{idx}][drive_token]')
    if attachment_url:
        attachment_obj['url'] = attachment_url
        if drive_token:
            attachment_obj['drive_token'] = drive_token
        attachments.append(attachment_obj)
```

#### In `/assignments/edit/<int:assignment_id>` route (POST method):

```python
# Added support for 'drive' type in new attachments (around line 3785)
elif attachment_type == 'drive':
    attachment_url = request.form.get(f'new_attachments[{idx}][url]')
    drive_token = request.form.get(f'new_attachments[{idx}][drive_token]')
    if attachment_url:
        attachment_obj['url'] = attachment_url
        if drive_token:
            attachment_obj['drive_token'] = drive_token
        existing_attachments.append(attachment_obj)
```

## New Features

### For Administrators:

1. **Three Attachment Types**:

   - üìÅ **File Upload**: Upload files directly to server
   - üîó **External Link**: Add any web URL
   - üìÇ **Google Drive**: Select files from Google Drive

2. **Seamless Drive Integration**:

   - One-click authorization
   - Browse entire Google Drive
   - Automatic file name population
   - Visual confirmation of selection

3. **Consistent Experience**:
   - Same interface for creating and editing assignments
   - Clear type indicators on existing attachments
   - Easy removal/modification of attachments

### For Students (Display):

- Attachments show with clear type indicators
- Click to open Drive files in new tab
- Shared Drive links work seamlessly

## Data Structure

### Attachment Object (stored as JSON in database):

```json
{
  "name": "Chapter 5 Notes",
  "type": "drive",
  "url": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/ABC123.../view",
  "drive_token": "ya29.a0AfH6..." // Optional
}
```

### Supported Types:

- `"file"` - Local file upload
- `"link"` - External URL
- `"drive"` - Google Drive file

## Configuration Required

### Google Cloud Console Setup:

1. **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**: For user authorization
2. **API Key**: For accessing Drive API
3. **Enabled APIs**:
   - Google Drive API
   - Google Picker API

### Update Constants in Both HTML Files:

```javascript
const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = "YOUR-CLIENT-ID.apps.googleusercontent.com";
const GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR-API-KEY";
const GOOGLE_APP_ID = "YOUR-PROJECT-NUMBER";
```

See `GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Storage**:

   - Tokens stored client-side during session (volatile)
   - Optional server-side storage for future features
   - Tokens expire after ~1 hour

2. **Permissions**:

   - Uses `drive.readonly` scope (minimal permissions)
   - Only reads file metadata and creates shareable links
   - Cannot modify or delete files

3. **Access Control**:
   - Users must have Drive permissions to selected files
   - Shared link visibility depends on Drive sharing settings
   - Students need appropriate permissions to view files

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new assignment with Drive attachment
- [ ] Edit existing assignment and add Drive attachment
- [ ] Delete Drive attachment from assignment
- [ ] View assignment as student with Drive attachment
- [ ] Test with multiple attachment types (mixed)
- [ ] Verify authorization flow on first use
- [ ] Test with different Google accounts
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Older browsers may need polyfills

## Known Limitations

1. Token expiration after 1 hour (requires re-authorization)
2. Can only select one file at a time per attachment slot
3. No folder selection support (files only)
4. Requires internet connection for Drive API calls

## Future Improvements

1. Implement refresh token flow for persistent access
2. Add support for selecting multiple files at once
3. Cache file metadata to reduce API calls
4. Add file preview/thumbnail display
5. Support Google Docs export formats
6. Implement batch file operations

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:

1. **Remove Google API scripts** from both HTML files
2. **Remove Drive-related CSS** (search for "Google Drive" comments)
3. **Revert `addAttachmentField()` function** to remove Drive button
4. **Revert backend changes** in `admin.py` (remove `elif attachment_type == 'drive'` blocks)
5. **Remove Google Drive JavaScript** (entire section at bottom of files)

Alternatively, use git to revert to the previous commit before this integration.
